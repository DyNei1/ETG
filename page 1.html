                    <p>The Bullet King chases the player around the room while attacking with his throne. The Bullet King has several different attacks:
                        <br>&diams; he spins and fires lots of bullets in two patterns. This is followed by a circle of bullets. This attack puts The bullet king on a cooldown.
                        <br>&diams; Bullets in a circular formation, some bulllets may move towards player.
                        <br>&diams; Three spread of 4 bullets in the players direction.
                        <br>&diams; Fires a giant bullet which spreads into smaller bullets and then those smaller bullets burst into even smaller bullets.
                        <br>&diams; throws a flask full of gasoline which ignites after a bullet hits it.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Gatling Gull chases the player around the room while rapidly firing random amounts of bullets in the players directions. The gatling Gull has several attacks:
                        <br>&diams; Fires a burst of many bullets in a circular line towards player.
                        <br>&diams; Charges up a massive bullet that spreads into many smaller bullets upon impact.
                        <br>&diams; Jumps up off the screen and lands on a player if they don't move.
                        <br>&diams; jumps up off the screen and lands in a random location after which he will start firing rockets that land from the sky in players location.
                        <br>&diams; If player gets too close the gatling gull will swing his minigun.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Trigger Twins both have similar types of attack:
                        <br>&diams; Charges at the player. Charge is stopped by dealing damage to them.
                        <br>&diams; Fires 6 bullets with precision towards the player.
                        <br>&diams; Jumps up and after hitting the ground it sends bullets in all direction.
                        <br>&diams; Does a Snapping/Whistling animation after which bullet kins are summoned.
                        <br>&diams; Each twin also have their unique attacks: Smiley will rapidly fire a stream of bullets. Shades will fire triple bullets back to back 3 times.
                        <br>&diams; When one of the twins die the other one will become enraged shooting even faster and shooting more.
